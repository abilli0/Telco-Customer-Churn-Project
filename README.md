Telco Customer Churn Project

Motivation:
I completed this project to practice combining SQL and Python for real-world data analysis. The main goal was to understand how many customers churn and identify key factors influencing churn.

Project Summary:
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in the telecommunications sector. By leveraging Python and SQL, we explore the dataset to uncover patterns and build predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving.

Objectives:
- Analyze customer demographics and service usage patterns.
- Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Develop predictive models to forecast churn.
- Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

Tools & Skills:
Python | Pandas | SQLAlchemy | PyMySQL | Matplotlib | Seaborn | MySQL | Jupyter Notebook | Git & GitHub
  
Data Exploration:
- Loaded data from MySQL database using SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.
- Visualized data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Why It Matters:
Customer churn analysis helps companies reduce revenue loss by understanding why customers leave. This project demonstrates my ability to work with real datasets, write clean code, and extract actionable insights â€” skills essential for data analyst or entry-level data science roles.
