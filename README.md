Telco Customer Churn Project

Motivation
I completed this project to practice combining SQL and Python for real-world data analysis. The main goal was to understand how many customers churn and identify key factors influencing churn.

What I Did:
- Connected to a MySQL database using Python, SQLAlchemy, and PyMySQL
- Loaded and explored customer churn data using Pandas
- Analyzed churn rates and customer demographics
- Created visualizations (pie charts, bar graphs) with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Identified patterns behind customer churn behavior

Tools & Skills:
Python | Pandas | SQLAlchemy | PyMySQL | Matplotlib | Seaborn | MySQL | Jupyter Notebook | Git & GitHub

Project Summary:
This beginner-friendly data science project involved analyzing a telecom dataset to understand customer churn. I practiced data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Jupyter Notebook and connected Python to a MySQL database to work with real data.

What I Learned:
- How to connect Python to a MySQL database
- Data cleaning and exploration with Pandas
- Visualizing data insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Version control and project sharing using Git and GitHub

Why It Matters:
Customer churn analysis helps companies reduce revenue loss by understanding why customers leave. This project demonstrates my ability to work with real datasets, write clean code, and extract actionable insights â€” skills essential for data analyst or entry-level data science roles.
