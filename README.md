Telco Customer Churn Project

Project Summary:
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in the telecommunications sector. By leveraging Python and SQL, we explore the dataset to uncover patterns and build predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving.

Objectives:
- Analyze customer demographics and service usage patterns.
- Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Develop predictive models to forecast churn.
- Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

Tools & Skills:
Languages: Python SQL
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, 
Database: MySQL
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
  
Data Exploration:
- Connected to MySQL database using SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL.
- Loaded data into Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.
- Visualized data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Results
- Identified key predictors of churn such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
- Achieved an accuracy of XX% with the Random Forest model.

Why It Matters:
Customer churn analysis helps companies reduce revenue loss by understanding why customers leave. This project demonstrates my ability to work with real datasets, write clean code, and extract actionable insights â€” skills essential for data analyst or entry-level data science roles.
