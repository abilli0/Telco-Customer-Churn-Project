Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This is a beginner data science project where I analyzed a real-world telecom dataset to understand customer churn behavior using Python, MySQL, and Jupyter Notebook.

Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- MySQL (data loaded from database)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub

What I Did:
- Loaded and explored the data using Pandas
- Connected MySQL to Python using SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL
- Analyzed churn rates and customer demographics
- Created visualizations like pie charts and bar graphs
- Identified patterns behind customer churn

What I Learned:
- How to connect a MySQL database to Python
- How to clean and analyze data with Pandas
- How to visualize churn patterns using Seaborn/Matplotlib
- Git and GitHub for version control and showcasing work

Why It Matters:
Customer churn analysis helps companies reduce revenue loss. This project shows my ability to work with real data, write clean code, and pull insights from raw data â€” all key skills for a data analyst or entry-level data science role.

This project is part of my portfolio to break into the data/analytics field. If you're a recruiter or hiring manager, feel free to connect with me!
