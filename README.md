Telco Customer Churn Project

This project dives into customer churn data from a fictional telco company. The goal is to understand why customers leave and identify patterns that can help businesses improve retention.

What I Did:

- Connected to a MySQL database using Python and pulled customer data

- Explored the dataset using Pandas and visualized churn trends with Matplotlib and Seaborn

- Checked for missing values and cleaned the data where needed

- Analyzed which features (like contract type, internet service, etc.) are most related to churn

- Created visuals like pie charts and bar plots to show insights clearly

Why This Matters:

Understanding customer churn is a real business challenge. Companies lose a lot of money when users leave, and this kind of analysis helps them know why — so they can fix it. Doing this project helped me practice data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization — all essential skills for a real data analyst or data scientist.

Tools Used:

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
MySQL (Workbench)
Jupyter Notebook
GitHub
